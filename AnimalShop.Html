            <p>Here is some awesome info about the baby animals we have for sale. THIS DOG COST 32403985 MILLIONS OBVIOUSLY This is an excellent way to get some natural Kitty aggression, stalking, pouncing and attacking directed into proper play. Also another important bonding experience with your furry friend.  This will teach them to play in an appropriate manner.
     We can take the cat out of the jungle, but we can’t take the jungle out of the cat. There is a little tiger in every house cat, a solitary predator that needs to exercise its hunting skills on a regular basis. We may have confined this little tiger within four walls, provided them with the finest of feline foods, but we can’t ignore their basic need to do that for which it was so perfectly designed – to HUNT.  Fortunately, it is not always necessary for the prey to be alive, but it must move.
     Two cats playing on white backgroundOwners are often frightened by the playfully aggressiveness in cats and kittens because they look quite intense when they play. They silently ambush feet and ankles as they pass by surprising, upsetting, and sometimes, even hurting a family member. In some cases the cat owners have not intentionally trained their cat to be a feline terrorist by playing with it as a kitten with their hands or feet.  The solution is to direct the cat’s playful, predatory, energies toward toys instead of moving hands or feet.
